Armed with a telescope and fueled by a curiosity for the unknown, I'm on a cosmic journey beyond the familiar boundaries of Earth. Growing up surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan's shores, my fascination with the stars began early.From those early nights of stargazing to dreaming of exploring distant worlds, my curiosity has always been sky-high. Now, I'm thrilled to share the wonders of the universe with you. Join me on this adventure as we explore the mysteries, beauty, and science that the cosmos has to offer. Welcome to our cosmic journey together!
