# "Key Facts About **Stars**"

## Stars, celestial bodies in the night sky, originate from vast nebulae composed of gas and dust. These stellar nurseries facilitate the birth of stars through gravitational collapse. The color of a star corresponds to its temperature and age; blue stars are hotter, while red stars are cooler. Our sun, a G-type main-sequence star, constitutes over 99% of the solar system's mass. The twinkling effect observed is due to atmospheric turbulence bending starlight. Additionally, stars culminate their life cycle through phenomena such as supernovae, explosive events signifying the endpoint of stellar evolution. These scientific insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the cosmos.
